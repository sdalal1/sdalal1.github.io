## Project: Quadruped Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Weaving on Unitree Go 1

**Description:**

This project is highly inspired from the Extreme-Parkour package created by CMU. The objective of this project is to train Unitree Go1 in IsaacGym simulation top perform weaving around poles. 

The training videos is as follows:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/Unitree_distillation.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">

</div>


A sim to real pipeline test of [quadruped_locomotion_project
](https://github.com/muye1202/quadruped_locomotion_project) package:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/pipeline_test.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
