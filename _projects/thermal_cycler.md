## IoT Glass Testing Device

**Description:**
- Developed an IoT-based glass testing system using a Raspberry Pi and Python. Implemented a PID control loop for optimized testing cycles, calibrated sensors for accurate temperature control, and integrated basic IoT functionalities using HTML and CSS for remote monitoring.

**Key Points:**
- Made the design from scratch using 3D printed components, switches, relays, heater, fan, thermocouple, buttons and LCD screen controlled using GPIO connector on the Raspberry Pi. 
- Implement PID control for efficient testing cycles and sensor calibration for temperature accuracy.
- Integrate basic IoT features for remote monitoring using HTML/CSS.
- The image below shows flowchart of the system:

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/thermocycler_flowchart.png" title="S image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Results:**
Achieved stable and consistent testing conditions with the PID control loop. Sensor calibration ensured accurate temperature control during testing. Basic IoT integration enabled remote monitoring and control capabilities.

**Video:**
The test video using a plastic container as the enviornment for safety:
