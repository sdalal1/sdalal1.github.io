## IoT Glass Testing Device

**Description:**
- The goal is to implement a feature based Extended Kalman Filter SLAM on a turtlebot3 in simulation as well as on a real robot.

**Circle:**
The video of controlling theturtlebot to move in a circle:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/circle_turtlebot.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>


**Video:**
The SLAM implementation in Simulation

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/Slam_sim.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
