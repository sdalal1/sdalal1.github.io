## Project: Collaboratively Developing a Low-Cost Fluorescence-Based Contact Imaging System for Portable Microfluidic Assays

#### Overview:
The project objective was developing a low-cost fluorescence-based contact imaging system for portable microfluidic assays. Microfluidic technology has significantly advanced biosensing, offering precise control over fluid flow and biological reactions. However, traditional fluorescence microscopy has been challenging to integrate into portable diagnostic devices due to its complexity and cost. Our project aimed to address this gap by creating an affordable solution suitable for primary care settings and homes.

#### Objective:
Our main objective was to collaboratively develop a compact fluorescence-based contact imaging system that could seamlessly integrate with microfluidic chips, making advanced diagnostics more accessible.

#### Our Contributions:
- **Thermocycler Prototyping:** As part of the team, I contributed to prototyping a thermocycler for a micro PCR testing device using a Peltier element controlled through Arduino and PID control loops. This component ensured precise temperature control critical for DNA amplification processes within the microfluidic environment. The Thermocycler was build using Peltier Elements, H-drive to drive the direction of Temperature and Pt-RTD sensors as thermal sensors.

- **Integration Efforts:** Additionally, I played a role in integrating the thermocycler with CMOS imager and microfluidic chip components, aiming for smooth and efficient operation of the entire system.

#### Impact of Our Work:
- Our collaborative efforts aimed to democratize fluorescence-based biosensing, striving to make it accessible beyond traditional laboratory settings.
- By integrating the thermocycler, we collectively enhanced the affordability and portability of the diagnostic system, potentially benefiting resource-limited environments and decentralized healthcare settings.
- Collectively, our project advances the development of low-cost, portable diagnostic tools, with the potential to significantly improve healthcare accessibility and delivery.
