Hi, I am Shail Dalal, 

I am a Masters of Robotics student at Northwestern University. I hold a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland, where my focus on human-robot interactions and sensor fusion began. During my studies, I designed a specialized thermo-cycler for a USB-size PCR testing apparatus. Professionally, I've worked as both a design engineer in security systems and an automation software engineer at Texas Instruments, gaining valuable experience in enhancing existing systems. My passion lies in robotics, aiming to innovate and automate established technologies, pushing the boundaries of automation and robotics.

Ohh and I love dogs!!
